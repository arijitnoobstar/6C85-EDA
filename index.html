			<h2>Subtheme: Speculation</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Over the last 24 years in Boston, what are the trends in the characteristics of property sales for investor buyers and
					non-investor buyers? </li>
				<li>How do different groups of investors and non-investors engage in property flipping in Boston and how do they benefit?</li>
				<li>What patterns do we see among buyer-seller pairs for properties in Boston?</li>
				<!-- ... Add more questions if necessary -->
			</ol>

			<h2> Exploring the Dataset</h2>
			<p> This dataset initially contains about 49,000 entries of housing sale transactions
				in Boston over the last 24 years. The dataset contains a lot of information on the characteristics
				of each sales transaction that include investor data and pricing data. 

				To explore the dataset, we analyze the spread of variables among all columns to 'gut-check' and
				see if their entries make sense. What I found immediately was that there are some nonsensical entries which we must filter out. 
				The first thing I did was to filter out property prices within an acceptable range. I included homes that cost between $100,000
				and $3,650,000. The upper bound was so that we can analyze the topic of speculation that does not include the 
				ultra-wealthy. That would fit more towards the "housing for rich" subtheme. In this analysis, I am interested to see How
				investor activity differs from that of non-investors in the more affordable price range (I say this
				while acknowledging a 3.65 mil house falls a bit too far from my affordable range). The upper limit removes the 
				top 5% of entries. The next thing I did was to remove data entries with no lat/long coordinates as I could not
				visualze them on a map. I then did a further preliminary analysis by visualization.
				</p>


				<h4>Outliers and Anomalies</h4> 
				<p>The preliminary examination of the data revealed several outliers in key variables of interest, such as 'bathrooms', 'mortgage', 'lotsize', and 'totrooms'. Outliers can skew the results and may not be representative of the dataset as a whole.</p>
				<h4>Boxplot Analysis</h4>
				<p>To identify and understand the nature of these outliers, boxplots were generated for each of these variables. The boxplots highlighted data points that were significantly distant from the rest of the data distribution, signaling the need for further inspection.</p>

			<img src="cleanbathroom.png" alt="Description of Image 1">
			<p>For 'bathrooms' and 'totrooms', values that were beyond the typical range for residential properties were removed, as they were likely to be data entry errors or properties not relevant to the typical homebuyer.
				Anything with more than 8 total rooms or 4 bathrooms were filtered out.
			</p>
			<img src="cleanmortgage.png" alt="Description of Image 1">
			<p>The 'mortgage' variable contained some extremely high values, potentially indicating data entry errors. These were trimmed to include only the range consistent with residential financing. The image above 
				shows clear outliers that need to be removed.
			</p>
			<img src="cleanplotsize.png" alt="Description of Image 1">
			<p>he 'lotsize' variable also had outliers that could represent large inaccuracies. These were adjusted to focus on typical residential property sizes.
			The image above clearly shows that there are outliers for lot sizes which were removed.
			</p>

			The resulting cleaned variables exhibited a much tighter distribution, which could then be used for more accurate analysis. This process not only improved the dataset's overall quality but also ensured that subsequent insights would be based on reliable and relevant data.

			<p>The heatmap above shows the general region of the property sales. The gut check shows that the properties
				are indeed spread around the Boston area. One interesting observation is that most of the purchases happen 
				in the central part of Boston (Back Bay to Beacon Hill, to South End, North End, Financial District etc.). The home
				prices are also higher in these areas than the prices in the other districts of Boston, liek Dorchester
				or Mattapan etc. This might reflect either a bias in the data collection or property transactions or flipping
				happens more often in the central Boston area. We are now in a good shape to explore the questions posed.
